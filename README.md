# Projection-Free Adaptive Gradients for Large-Scale Optimization

This repository contains the code to reproduce the experiments in our [paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.14114.pdf):
> C. W. Combettes, C. Spiegel, and S. Pokutta. Projection-Free Adaptive Gradients for Large-Scale Optimization. *arXiv preprint arXiv:2009.14114*, 2020.

Two online Jupyter Notebooks via Google Colab are available:
- [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1XYYZ3SPsppR8QQq2lVrapj7G7kbWotPg) for the experiments with convex objectives (Section 4.1), and
- [here](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/16OU67J7c4M0LcQWrgR5Nd3oOf3n3A4K7) for the experiments with nonconvex objectives (Section 4.2).
